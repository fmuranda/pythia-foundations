In addition, the value of this attribute must be parsable by the [UDUNITS](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/) library. In this example, the temperatures are in Kelvin, so we set the units attribute to `'Kelvin'`. Next, we set the `long_name` and `standard_name` attributes, which are recommended for most datasets, but optional. The `long_name` attribute contains a longer and more detailed description of a variable. On the other hand, the `standard_name` attribute names a variable using descriptive words from a predefined word list contained in the CF conventions. Defining these attributes allows users of your datasets to understand what each variable in a dataset represents. Sometimes, data fields do not have valid data values at every dimension point. In this case, the standard is to use a filler value for these missing data values, and to set the `missing_value` attribute to this filler value. In this case, however, there are no missing values, so the `missing_value` attribute can be set to any unused value, or not set at all.\n",

        "We have created examples of and discussed the structure of **netCDF** `Datasets`, both gridded and in-situ. In addition, we covered the Climate and Forecasting (**CF**) Conventions, and the setup of netCDF files that follow these conventions. netCDF `Datasets` are self-describing; in other words, their attributes, or *metadata*, are included. Other libraries in the Python scientific software ecosystem, such as `xarray` and `MetPy`, are therefore easily able to read in, write to, and analyze these `Datasets`.\n",
